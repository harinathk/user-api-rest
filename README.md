# Technical Challenge

Develop a web application with one endpoint, eg GET http://localhost:8080/users

## Getting Started

This backend version of the User Info application only provides a REST API. There is no UI.

## Running User API locally
### With maven command line
git clone https://github.com/harinathk/user-api-rest.git
cd user-api-rest
./mvnw spring-boot:run
